## **üß† Calculation Logic:**

### **Core Financial Calculations:**
```typescript
// Mortgage Payment Calculation
const monthlyPayment = (loanAmount * monthlyRate * Math.pow(1 + monthlyRate, totalPayments)) / 
                      (Math.pow(1 + monthlyRate, totalPayments) - 1);

// Total Investment
const totalInvestment = downPayment + registrationFees + agentCommission;

// ROI Calculation
const totalROI = ((netAnnualIncome * holdingPeriod + totalAppreciation) / totalInvestment) * 100;

// IRR Calculation
const irr = Math.pow((finalPropertyValue + totalRentalIncome) / totalInvestment, 1 / holdingPeriod) - 1;
```

### **UAE-Specific Considerations:**
- **Registration Fees:** 4% + AED 2,000
- **Agent Commission:** 2% standard
- **Service Charges:** 1.5% of property value annually
- **Insurance:** 0.5% of property value annually
- **Typical Mortgage Rates:** 3.5% (adjustable)
- **Down Payment:** 20% standard for off-plan
